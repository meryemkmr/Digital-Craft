            <h2>History of Cheesecake</h2>
            <p>Ever since the dawn of time, mankind has striven to create the perfect cheesecake.
            The earliest history of the art is lost, but we know that cheesecake was 
            already a popular dish in ancient Greece. With the Roman conquest of Greece,
            the secret fell into Roman hands. The Roman name for this type of cake
            (derived from the Greek term,) became “placenta.”
            Placenta was more like a cheesecake, baked on a pastry base, or sometimes inside a pastry case.
            They were also called “libum” by the Romans, and were often used as an offering at their temples to their gods.</p>

            <h3>New York Cheesecake:</h3>
            <p>New York cheesecake is the pure, unadulterated cheesecake with no fancy ingredients
            added either to the cheesecake or placed on top of it.  It is made with pure cream 
            cheese, cream, eggs, and sugar.  Everybody has a certain image of New York Style Cheesecake.
            According to New Yorkers, only the great cheesecake makers are located in New York, 
            and the great cheesecake connoisseurs are also in New York.
            In the 1900s, cheesecakes were very popular in New York.
            Every restaurant had their version. I  believe the name “New York Cheesecake” came from
            the fact that New Yorkers referred to the cheesecakes made in New York as “New York Cheesecake.” 
            New Yorkers say that cheesecake was not really cheesecake until it was cheesecake in New York.</p>
